"""Fixes for the installed `reachy_sdk` (v1, 0.7.0), applied once per process.

THE COMMAND-POLL LEAK
---------------------
`ReachySDK._poll_waiting_commands` runs once per command push (up to 100 Hz
while commands flow).  Each call creates one asyncio task per joint, waiting
on that joint's `_need_sync` event, returns as soon as ONE fires, and never
cancels the rest.  A task for a joint that is never commanded -- on this
robot the left arm, the neck and the antennas, 13-14 of 21 joints when only
the right arm moves -- never completes, so every push leaves 13-14 tasks
pending on the SDK's loop for the life of the process.

Measured (2026-10-09, offline with the installed SDK code, emulated amd64
container): 14 pending tasks and 112 GC-tracked objects per push, linear;
4,000 pushes = +448k objects and a full collection 26 -> 75 ms.  A lift
streams at least ~5,000 pushes, so a process that is kept between lifts (the
panel's motion worker) collects ever longer: generation-2 pauses grew 7 ->
124 ms inside one lift, and a 0.67 s pause halted attempt 5 of the
2026-10-08 measurement on stale feedback (consistent; not proven).

The fix is the same function with the losers cancelled.  Cancelling an
`asyncio.Event.wait()` removes its waiter, so nothing is retained.  Which
commands are sent is unchanged: they are built from the events, not from the
tasks.

PORTING NOTE: any long-lived `reachy_sdk` 0.7.0 client that commands a
subset of the joints has this leak, on the real robot as on the simulator.
